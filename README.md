# CIP-Corridor-Study-With-Python-
An exhaustive study about flow in corridors and such things. So cool!
ndications of use:

The program asks you a series of questions about:

- The dimensions of the hallway: give a whole number of rows and columns.
- How many people are there at the beginning: give a whole number for each side.
- The entry flow from each side, both the number of people and how often they appear. Give whole numbers.
- How many turns you want to extend the animation. Give a whole number.

The program returns the following:

- Prints a development of the situation on the screen.
- Prints on the screen the number of people arriving on each side of each type.
- How long it takes to execute.
- How many times you have executed the addresses function.

- Generates a .gif file that shows the animation, the same as the one printed on the screen, under the name animacion.
- Generates a .png file that shows the vector field, under the name camp_vectorial.
- Generates a .png file that shows the heatmap, under the name heatmap.

There is a .zip, when it is unzipped, you must enter the distr folder and run the .exe file.
